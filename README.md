## About

### Open-Science-Paper 

The Open-Science-Paper
[repository](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Paper) contains a
LaTeX document which is thought to be forked and used for scientific,
collaborative paper writing on GitHub. It combines the LaTeX typesetting
capabilities with the R programming language for statistics, using the
[Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) R package. This combination allows for the
production of executable documents to enhance the reproducibility of your
research.

The Open-Science-Paper offers a clean and logical folder structure and
some examples of typical typesetting requirements to typeset your paper.
A makefile helps you to compile, clean and archive the document. The
layout of the document is close to common scientific paper formats. For
an example see the PDF file in the repository or the documentation in the
[wiki](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Paper/wiki). The document layout
can help you to prepare figures and tables for publication. But you can also
use the Open-Science-Paper to just produce nice looking, paper like formatted
documents.

The project is documented in detail on the Open-Science-Paper
[wiki](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Paper/wiki) page. The wiki
covers information about how to get started with the document, a workflow for
collaborative paper writing on GitHub and much more.
