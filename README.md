## About

### Open-Science-Paper 

The Open-Science-Paper
[repository](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Paper) contains a LaTeX
document which is thought to be forked and used for scientific, collaborative
paper writing on GitHub. The Open-Science-Paper combines the LaTeX typesetting
capabilities with the power of the R programming language for statistics, using
the [Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package. This combination allows for the
production of executable documents which enhances the reproducibility of your
research.

The Open-Science-Paper offers a clean and logical folder structure and
some example data of typical things required to typeset your paper. The
layout of the document is close to common scientific paper formats. For
an example see the PDF file in the repository or the documentation in the
[wiki](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Paper/wiki). The layout can help
to prepare figures and tables for publication. But you can also use the document
just to produce nice looking, paper like formatted documents. 

A makefile helps you to compile, clean and archive the document
and a documentation you can find on the Open-Science-Paper
[wiki](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Paper/wiki). The wiki covers
information about how to get started with the document, a workflow for
collaborative paper writing on GitHub and much more.
