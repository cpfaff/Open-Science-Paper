\subsection*{Introduction}

\paragraph{Scope}

Under ever increasing pressure on ecosystems by climate and land use change,
biodiversity continues to decline. At the same time, there is a growing
evidence, that biodiversity is crucial for ecosystem functioning. To inform
decision makers, scientists from different disciplines increasingly collaborate
to show the impact of decreasing biodiversity on ecosystem functioning. However,
data describing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are complex in structure
and distributed across different repositories and research groups. To make use
of the opportunities of accessing data online, biodiversity scientists are
exploring how semantic tools can help in the automatic assembly of data from
distributed resources. Due to the complexity of the data, semantic tools will
be of highest use and generality, when the complexity involved in analytic
operations is low.

\paragraph{Aim}

We want to analyse a typical scientific workflow that combines datasets from
different research groups and look for an optimal entry point for semantic
tools.

\paragraph{Questions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How can complexity be quantified for finite operations calculated within a scientific workflow?
	\item Does the complexity of operations stay constant throughout the scientific workflow?
	\item Can workflow operations be grouped meaningfully into tasks?
	\item Do tasks differ in complexity?
	\item Are all tasks used similarly in the course of the workflow?
	\item Do datasets differ in the usage of their variables?
\end{itemize}
